# ls-js-value
A javascript/ecmascript implementation of native types: undefined, null, NaN, Infinity, boolean, number, string, array and object

1. seperate out the header from the source
2. add istream support
3. finish casting for arrays and objects
4. implement json stringify and parse
5. add symbols
6. impliment iff file read and write support
7. add documentation and api reference
8. add jekyl site with examples and how to support this mini project
